A introduction to the wide world of computers, how they work and the role they play in our world

Welcome to the Course! The primary goal of the course is the following:
a) to plant a seed of curiousity about computers and the world we have created with them
b) that it is okay to not know everything and to keep asking questions!

The Course is broken up into sections
Every section follows the following topology:
- Title of Section
    - Section Scope
    - Content
        - Readings / Clips (To be completed before the session )
        - Notes
        - Discussion ( done in session )
    - Progression 
        - Learning Outcomes 
        - Tasks 

The sections are meant to be a combination of self studies by the mentee and a Q&A session with the mentor (live or online) to address questions or discuss a topic.

A schedule will be provided at the Kickoff to cover the Q&A sessions.
