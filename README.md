A introductory to the world of computers, how they work and the role they play in our world

Welcome to the Course! The primary goal of the course is the following:
a) to plant a seed of curiousity about computers and the world we have created with them
b) that it is okay to not know everything and to keep asking questions!

The Course is broken up into sections which have a topic / theme. There will be a readme file in each section that will provide the section contect as well as explain any tasks within that section.

The sections are meant to be self studied by the mentee and a daily Q&A session either (live or online) to address questions or cover a topic.

A schedule will be provided at the Kickoff to cover the Q&A sessions and expectations for finishing the Section content.
