# Amit4Linux
A introduction to the wide world of computers, how they work and the role they play in our world

Welcome to the Course! The primary goal of the course is the following:
a) to plant a seed of curiousity about computers and the world we have created with them
b) that it is okay to not know everything and to keep asking questions!

### Course Section Format
The Course is broken up into sections
Every section follows the following topology:
- Title of Section (contains title of the section)
    - Section Scope ( the topics we will discuss and study)
    - Content (The actual topics material)
        - Readings / Clips (To be completed before the session )
        - Notes (any further notes, for self study or demonstration )
        - Discussion ( done in session )
    - Progression ( identifying what the session is meant to achieve)
        - Learning Outcomes (The distilled concept to be understood when moving on) 
        - Tasks ( Excercises to be carried out before the next session )

The sections are meant to be a combination of self studies by the mentee and a Q&A session with the mentor (live or online) to address questions or discuss a topic.

A schedule will be provided at the Kickoff to cover the Q&A sessions.
