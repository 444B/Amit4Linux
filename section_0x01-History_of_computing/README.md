### Discussion  
[ This is expected to take place live or online]
## Progression  
### Learning Outcomes  
- To be familiar with how computers have developed over time
- Understanding the concept of abstraction within computing and Tech
- To be familiar with Linux and what makes it unique 
- To realise that even for me to type these simple sentences into my computer and share it to the whole entire world is an absolute fucking miracle that relies on millions of different components to work in tandem and that the internet is literally magic. We have tricked Sand into thinking with Logic and that is kinda cool. We have more potential in our fingertips than most empires had in their existance. SO yeah anyways
