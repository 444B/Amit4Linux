## Content  
### Course Outline  
The outline of this course is visible from the repo root directory.   We begin with an introduction, move into the history of computing and the context of these devices, start using linux, move on to networking and cloud computing, discuss the issue of Cyber Security and the solutions and time permitted we will talk about some corporate tips and tricks and what to expect when working in a large company  

### Getting set up
Please refer to another repository I have made for Linux workshops  
https://github.com/444B/CLI  
- it is reccomended to get [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for whichever OS you have  
- Download a suitable Linux Operating system. I reccomend [Ubuntu 20.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/)  
- We will go through the installation process but there are videos online that explain the process adequately. Here is a [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S26CKNo4Tgs) that will explain the installation process if you want to get started sooner.
